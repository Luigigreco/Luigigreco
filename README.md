## 🧭 Trajectory

I didn’t move into AI.  
I followed the stack as it evolved.

- **Late ’90s – early 2000s**  
  Built interactive systems with HTML and Flash, when the web was still a medium to be invented.  
  Early focus on interaction, performance, and constraints.

- **2006–2010**  
  Founded **01Design**, among the first mobile agencies in Italy (pre-iPhone).  
  Designed and shipped early mobile platforms under extreme device, network, and UX constraints.

- **2010–2015**  
  Shifted from standalone products to large-scale digital ecosystems.  
  Worked on multi-channel, multi-stakeholder platforms with enterprise-level complexity.

- **2015–2020**  
  Led UX and service design within global IT consulting environments.  
  Designed systems operating across organizations, markets, and regulatory contexts.

- **Today**  
  Founder @ **CONFLUX**.  
  Designing Agentic UX, AI-driven systems, and human–AI workflows for complex, real-world processes.
